*Irish & Romkey, “What is Technology”*


| **Key Term / Idea**                                    | **Explanation**                                                                                                               | **Critiques / Ethical Implications**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technology definitions**(Volti, Nightingale, Latour) | Technology as more than artifacts: systems, knowledge, maintenance, labor, infrastructure, and social meaning.                | If we see only “gadgets,” we miss hidden labor, social systems, and power structures.                                      |
| **Power & goals**(C.S. Lewis)                          | Technology can serve the goals of some at the expense of others.                                                              | Raises ethical question:*Whose flourishing is being advanced?*                                                               |
| **Human flourishing (Aristotle, Bowen)**               | Goal of ethics/engineering is to promote flourishing through material well-being.                                             | Engineers must ask whether technologies genuinely contribute to flourishing or merely profit.                                |
| **Pathology 1: Technology as gadget**(Nightingale)     | Seeing tech as isolated artifacts.                                                                                            | Leads to blind spots: ignoring tacit knowledge, social context, or risks.                                                    |
| **Pathology 2: Technology as worldview**               | Tech seen as “natural” or invisible.                                                                                        | This is*technological determinism*: assuming tech dictates society, reducing critical thinking.                              |
| **Socio-technical dualism**                            | Separation of “technical” and “social” in engineering education.                                                          | Risks producing engineers blind to ethics, politics, environment, and stakeholder perspectives.                              |
| **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**(previewed)              | Tech = system of artifacts, people, institutions.                                                                             | Useful framework for integrated ethical analysis of engineering designs.                                                     |
| **Neil Postman’s Five Things about Technology**       | 1. All change is trade-off. 2. Winners vs losers. 3. Every tech has an idea. 4. Change is ecological. 5. Media become mythic. | Tools for critique: ask who benefits/loses, what worldview is embedded, what gets ignored, and what becomes “naturalized.” |

## *Irish, “Worldview, Neoliberalism, and Learning to See”*


| **Key Term / Idea**                                  | **Explanation**                                                                                                     | **Critiques / Ethical Implications**                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Worldview (“water” parable)**                    | The invisible lens shaping how we see the world.                                                                    | Engineers often fail to see how ideology frames their practice.                             |
| **Three Big Questions**                              | Why am I here? Where did I come from? Where am I headed?                                                            | Connects existential purpose to engineering as service to society.                          |
| **Neoliberalism (Steger & Roy, Harvey)**             | Ideology: progress is inevitable, markets define value, individuals are responsible, deregulation is best.          | Individualism and market-focus can clash with engineering’s duty to the public good.       |
| **Shift from Classical Liberalism → Neoliberalism** | From protecting rights and merit goods (Keynesian welfare) to deregulated free-market economics (Reagan, Thatcher). | Erosion of collective goods (education, healthcare, environment).                           |
| **Economic & social impacts**                        | Globalization, tech boom, but also 2008 crash.                                                                      | Ethical critique: profit-driven engineering can amplify inequality and precarity.           |
| **Wealth concentration**                             | Neoliberalism enriches elites, weakens middle/lower classes.                                                        | Engineers designing for “winners” risk neglecting marginalized groups.                    |
| **Climate inaction**                                 | Growth ideology undermines regulation and collective climate action.                                                | Engineers face ethical tension: innovation for growth vs responsibility for sustainability. |
| **Engineering education impacts**                    | Two myths: (1) meritocracy, (2) depoliticization.                                                                   | These foster blindness to injustice, letting engineers avoid ethical/social concerns.       |
| **Cech’s critique**                                 | Social justice is sidelined in engineering culture.                                                                 | Frames ethics as “non-technical” → a false, dangerous separation.                        |
| **Final ethical challenge (Berry)**                  | “The only question: what’s the right thing to do? What does Earth require of us?”                                | Engineers must act beyond profit/efficiency to responsibility for future generations.       |

✅ **How to use these in class**:

* Use **Postman’s Five Things** as a framework for critiquing any new technology students bring up (AI, EVs, etc.).
* Contrast **neoliberal ideology** with the **engineer’s duty to public welfare** (Codes of Ethics).
* Discuss **flourishing vs profit**: is engineering serving humanity or markets?
* Debate **winners and losers**: Who gains/loses from EV batteries, social media, or AI deployment?
* Highlight **dualism vs integration**: Should engineers see social/political contexts as part of their work?

Do you want me to **merge these two tables** into a single *“Ethics Class Toolkit”* handout (with simplified phrasing, bullet points, and questions for students), or keep them separate for clarity?
